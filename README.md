# Discussion Questions: Props vs. State c

1. What is the difference between _props_ and _state_ in React?
2. When would you use state instead of props?
3. Assuming `UserDetail` is a component, what will its _props_ be if it's
   rendered as follows:

   ```js
   const user = {name: 'Spider Man', age: 32}

   <UserDetail title="Profile Page" dog="Fido" user={user} />
   ```

4. Take a look at `https://learning.flatironschool.com`. Pretend you were going
   to recreate a specific page. What top level components would you have? What
   props would they receive and what state would they own? What components would
   they have as children?
